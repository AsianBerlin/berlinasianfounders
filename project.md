## Purpose
For 2nd + 3rd (and further) generation children and youth from migrant parents/grandparents: Strengthen positive identification with the cultural roots&heritage of the expat parents/grandparents and thus strengthen their positive feeling of culturally connected self (empowerment from within) - while celebrating/accepting generational differences in the sense of proximity and relationship to the cultural roots/heritage. 
For expat families: strengthen family bond by helping members of different generations share the cultural roots&heritage and sense of belonging (non-exclusive) 
For the children and youth of the native local communities (within national territories): develop a sense of global connection and learn to enjoy and appreciate cultural diversity while practicing “extended communication” in the native language.
For the native local families: give their children exposure to communication with children who live in different cultural settings, help their children develop into adults with an open mind to cultural diversity, create opportunity for their children to connect deeper to the other culture and language community of the pen-pal friend (whom they might visit personally in the future and who would help them as host)

## How
Create lasting cross-border friendships between children/youth living outside of / within nation state territories - by initiating pen-friendships (analog and digital) between them through the shared language, and by encouraging/supporting them to continue friendship

Website with matchmaking function / order function for original postcards or envelopes with original stamps / mechanism to encourage continuation and writing frequently (track records, awards - you’re free to submit anonymized copy to Sekai Penpal, who can publish beautiful letters on the website)
